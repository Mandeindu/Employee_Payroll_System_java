# Employee Payroll System

## Overview

The Employee Payroll System is a Java application designed to manage employee payroll details. It demonstrates key object-oriented programming concepts such as classes, inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism. The system supports various employee types (Full-Time and Part-Time) and calculates their salaries based on specific criteria.

## Concepts Used

- **Classes**: `Employee`, `Payroll`
- **Inheritance**: `FullTimeEmployee`, `PartTimeEmployee`
- **Encapsulation**: Employee salary details are encapsulated within the `Employee` class.
- **Polymorphism**: Methods for salary calculations differ based on the employee type.

## Prerequisites

- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or later
- Integrated Development Environment (IDE) such as IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse
- Basic knowledge of Java programming and object-oriented principles

## How to Use the Project

1. **Create Employee Objects**:
   - Instantiate `FullTimeEmployee` or `PartTimeEmployee` with relevant details.

2. **Add Employees to Payroll**:
   - Utilize the `Payroll` class to add employees and compute their salaries.

3. **Calculate Salaries**:
   - Use the methods provided to calculate and display the salaries based on employee type.

## Tests

- **Unit Tests**: Basic unit tests for salary calculations and employee data are provided.
- **Run Tests**: Use a testing framework such as JUnit to execute and verify the functionality.
